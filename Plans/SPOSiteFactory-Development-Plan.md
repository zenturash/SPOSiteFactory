2. **Hub Architecture**: Build hub sites with associated team/communication sites
3. **Security Auditing**: Comprehensive security assessment based on Microsoft best practices
4. **Automated Remediation**: Fix security issues automatically or interactively
5. **Drift Detection**: Track and report configuration changes over time
6. **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple sites efficiently with parallel processing

### Target Users
- SharePoint Administrators
- Security Operations Teams
- IT Governance Teams
- DevOps Engineers
- Compliance Officers

- Hub site creation and association
- Security baseline auditing
- JSON configuration support
- Basic reporting (CSV/JSON)

### Priority 2 (Should Have)
- Bulk operations
- Interactive remediation
- HTML reports with visualizations
- Drift detection
- Advanced error handling

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- YAML support
- Auto-navigation configuration
- Email notifications
- Azure DevOps integration
- Custom templates

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required PowerShell Modules
```powershell
@{
    'PnP.PowerShell' = '3.0.0'
    'PSFramework' = '1.7.0'
    'Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement' = '1.1.2'
}
```

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
